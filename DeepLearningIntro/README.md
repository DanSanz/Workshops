## Introduction to Deep Learning 

This folder contains an Introduction to Deep Learning presentation and a Jupyter Notebook. 

The Jupyter Notebook is using the MNIST train and test sample datasets from the Azure Machine Learning Studio. If you don't have access to Azure Machine Learning or want to run it locally on your machine, you can download the MNIST from one of the online sources(a simple web search will provide a lot of options). The notebook is using Chainer (http://chainer.org/) to train four different neural networks.
